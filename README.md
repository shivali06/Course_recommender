# Course Recommender System
A recommendation system that would provide list of computer science courses to a student based on his interest. This will help student to make right choice which best suites his/her.

1. Start is the first command through which student will get to know what are the other commands for the course recommendation.

2. To get course recommendation according to the semester, use “getsem” command. Give the answer in 1,2,3 and 4. In my database I have assigned semester to all courses.

3. Student can choose the subject according to their like and dislike. I have made some criteria, first one is theory or programming and student can choose according to their interest. Then I have distributed all courses to some type, student can choose generic area from the list. The command is “getlike”.

4. Some are the function like getting the eligible course according to pre-requisite completed. Student can check are they eligible or not/ which courses they can take according to eligibility. Command is “getpre”

5. The course in which student has secured highest rank is the course best suits to him. I have taken user input in which he scored highest grad and eligible pre req subjects and then recommend him the courses. I have attached “qualities” some big generic to a subject. The course he scored highest would compare with other similar courses and recommend them.
The command is “rcmndtn”
  - Below is the screenshot.
